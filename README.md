2018-2019 Portfolio

Over the last 5 months, I've researched some very impressive and robust mechanics of user experience, usability, and future-proofing. In learning about these products and how they work, I have also pushed myself to develop alongside these miracles of imagination, and test the limits of what a consumer product can be.

The following is a list of the products borne of these past few months. 

1) [Eggs With Legs](https://github.com/chauphana/Eggs-with-Legs) 

Eggs With Legs is a two-dimensional platformer game based on the popular Bloons Tower Defense franchise. I assisted in the following processes of development:
- Debugging 
- Streamlining User Mechanics (image movement, latency, button placement, etc.)
- "Devil-ed Egg" artwork and image movement

2) [Tic-Tac Foe](https://github.com/imaadk/Tic-Tac-Foe)

Tic-Tac Foe is a game of Tic-Tac Toe that uses Apple's ARKit 2 protocol to simulate a virtual board game, complete with user interface buttons, text, and a basic augmented opponent. 

3) [Lava](https://github.com/imaadk/Lava)

Lava is a basic test program built from Apple's original ARKit used to detect a level plane in the real world and overlay an image in its axis. Don't touch the floor.
