2018-2019 Portfolio

Over the last 5 months, I've researched some very impressive and robust mechanics of user experience, usability, and future-proofing. In learning about these products and how they work, I have also pushed myself to develop alongside these miracles of imagination, and test the limits of what a consumer product can be.

The following is a list of the products borne of these past few months. 

[Eggs With Legs](https://github.com/chauphana/Eggs-with-Legs) 
Eggs With Legs is a two-dimensional platformer game based on the popular Bloons Tower Defense franchise. I assisted in the following processes of development:
- Debugging 
- Streamlining User Mechanics (image movement, latency, button placement, etc.)
- "Devil-ed Egg" artwork and image movement
